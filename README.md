A while ago, I decided to challenge myself to build a calendar date-picker from scratch with vanilla JavaScript as part of a now abandoned project. Extracted the calendar to revive with options for the user to customize:

Working now
   - whether to show a 5, 6 or 7 day week
   - whether to enable past dates to be selected
   
 Planned
   - colour scheme
